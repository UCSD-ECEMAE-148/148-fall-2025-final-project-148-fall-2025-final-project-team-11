## Abstract
The goal of this project is to develope a targeting system using OpenCV that scans, labels, and locks onto targets of interest, then allows for manual selection of a target. 
A two degree-of-freedom (DOF) gimbal mechanism accurately follows the selected target to keep it in frame at all times, constantly ready to fire a rocket engine.
